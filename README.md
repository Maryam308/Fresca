# Fresca ðŸ¥—

Fresca is a **full-stack recipe management app** built using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). It allows users to browse, create, edit, and delete recipes in a clean and intuitive interface. Whether you're a home cook or a culinary explorer, Fresca helps you organize your favorite dishes and discover new ones.

The goal of this project is to practice RESTful routing, and CRUD functionality within a well-designed UI.
